 -q1/ Stock Management System
 -q2/ Flight Booking System
 -q3/ Tax Administration System
 -q4/ Procurement Management System
 -q5/ Attendance Management System
 -q6/ Payroll Management System (RSSB)

Each subpackage includes:

- 10 related classes following a strict inheritance hierarchy  
- Encapsulated attributes (private fields + getters/setters)  
- Constructors with validation rules  
- Scanner-based user input  
- A `Main.java` entry point  
- A final class that performs calculations or generates a report  
- Outputs include the student ID (**d27813**)
